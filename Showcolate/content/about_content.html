<h1>About Showcolate</h1>

This main feature displays a cascading flow  of chocolate rotating on five spinning wheels behind a glass window.  Visible dark, milk and white chocolates circulate as they are prepared  for our sweet fondue. Our innovative kiosk system is made to ensure  maximum profitability at prime locations. </p>
